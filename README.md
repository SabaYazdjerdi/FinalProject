<p> Proposal: </p>
<p> As designers and artists we all would love to be known and show our works in a museum or some sort of exhibition spaces for people to see and get to know us and our works. I wanted to jump a couple of steps and create my own virtual gallery where people could walk through different rooms in an minimal and interactive website. Through looking at different interesting websites I would hope to be more clear about this idea and use them a guide to help me build my virtual space as an architect. </p>
